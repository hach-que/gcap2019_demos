# GCAP 2019 Demos - "So you want to make a multiplayer game?"

These examples demonstrate the concepts outlined in the "So you want to make a multiplayer game?" talk.

**These examples are for educational purposes only, and should not be used in a production application.** Please use something battle-tested and secure like [netcode.io](https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io) for your actual game protocol.
